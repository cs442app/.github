# CS 442: Mobile Application Development

This organization is [IIT's CS 442 class](https://moss.cs.iit.edu/cs442) GitHub home, hosting public repositories containing sample code and private machine problem repositories (shared with students).

If you're a student taking this class, you won't be creating any repositories here manually. Rather, look for [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms) invitation links on the [class website](https://moss.cs.iit.edu/cs442) to accept and clone assignment repositories.
